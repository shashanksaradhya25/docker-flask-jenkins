# 01-docker-flask-jenkins
Beginner-Friendly DevOps CI/CD Project – Flask App With Jenkins & Docker

This project is designed to help beginners understand how real DevOps pipelines work — step by step. 
You will learn the basics of automation, Docker, Jenkins pipelines, GitHub workflows, and deployment.  
 
Everything is broken down in simple terms so anyone can follow along. 
##  Tech Stack 
- Python (simple backend App)
- Jenkins (CI/CD)
- DockerHub (image registry)
- Github (version control)

##  Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](assets/deployment-flow.png)

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub  
2. Jenkins pulls code → builds Docker image  
3. Jenkins pushes image to DockerHub  
4. (Optional) Jenkins deploys container to EC2 or Kubernetes
